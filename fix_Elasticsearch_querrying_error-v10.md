The user has provided the output of a curl command that queries Elasticsearch and it seems to return hits from the 'chunks' index. This indicates that Elasticsearch indexing is working and documents are present.  The next step is to add the print statements in `query_rag_system` and `validate_answer` functions as suggested in the previous turn to understand the flow and identify where the process is failing. I will guide the user to add these print statements and rerun the query to analyze the output. This will help to determine if the issue is in retrieval, answer generation, or answer validation.

Action: Instruct user to add print statements in `query_rag_system` and `validate_answer` functions and rerun the query. Analyze the output to pinpoint the issue.

Please add these print statements to your `rag_app-v10.py` file. Then, **run the same query again** and provide the **complete output** from your terminal. This output will contain the valuable debugging information from the print statements, helping us understand what's happening during the query process and why you're getting the negative answer.

Specifically, look for these in the output:

* **"Number of relevant chunks retrieved"**: Is it a positive number? Or is it "No relevant chunks retrieved from hybrid_search."?
* **"First relevant chunk content (truncated)"**: Does the content seem relevant to your query?
* **"Context passed to LLM (truncated)"**: Does the context string look like it contains relevant information?
* **"Answer-Context Similarity"**, **"Answer-Query Similarity"**, **"Context Similarity Threshold"**: What are the calculated similarity scores and the threshold?
* **"Validation Result"**: Is it `True` or `False`?

Providing this output will allow me to give you more specific guidance on how to fix the issue.

---
Let's investigate why you are getting the "I apologize, but I cannot generate a reliable answer based on the provided context." message when querying `rag_app-v10.py`. This message is specifically returned when the `validate_answer` function evaluates to `False`. We need to examine the query process step-by-step to pinpoint the cause.

Here's a breakdown of potential issues and how to check them:

**1. No Relevant Context Retrieved (`relevant_chunks` is empty):**

* **Problem:** If the hybrid search fails to retrieve relevant document chunks for your query, the `context` passed to the LLM will be empty or irrelevant. This will likely lead to a poor answer, and `validate_answer` might correctly reject it.
* **How to Check:**
    * **Add print statements in `query_rag_system` to inspect `relevant_chunks`:**  Before the line `context = ...`, add:
        ```python
        print(f"Number of relevant chunks retrieved: {len(relevant_chunks)}")
        if not relevant_chunks:
            print("No relevant chunks retrieved. Inspect hybrid_search.")
        else:
            print("First relevant chunk content (truncated):", relevant_chunks[0]['chunk'][:100] if relevant_chunks else "No chunks")
        ```
    * **Inspect `hybrid_search` function:** Check if there are any errors in `hybrid_search` function. Are FAISS, BM25, or Elasticsearch searches returning results? If Elasticsearch is the primary source of your document content, verify that it's correctly indexed and searchable.

**2. Generated Answer is Not Relevant to the Context or Query (Validation Failure):**

* **Problem:** Even if relevant context is retrieved, the LLM might generate an answer that is not well-supported by the context or doesn't directly answer the query. The `validate_answer` function is designed to catch such cases.
* **How to Check:**
    * **Inspect `validate_answer` function's similarity scores:**  Add print statements inside `validate_answer` to see the calculated similarity scores and thresholds:
        ```python
        def validate_answer(answer: str, context: str, query: str) -> bool:
            # ... (rest of the function code) ...
            print(f"Answer-Context Similarity: {answer_context_sim:.4f}")
            print(f"Answer-Query Similarity: {answer_query_sim:.4f}")
            print(f"Context Similarity Threshold: {threshold:.4f}")
            validation_result = answer_context_sim > threshold and answer_query_sim > 0.6
            print(f"Validation Result: {validation_result}")
            return validation_result
        ```
    * **Analyze the output of these print statements:**  Are the `Answer-Context Similarity` and `Answer-Query Similarity` scores consistently low? Is the `Validation Result` always `False`? If so, it indicates the generated answer is not considered relevant according to the validation criteria.
    * **Loosen validation thresholds (temporarily for debugging):**  To check if the validation is overly strict, you can temporarily reduce the thresholds in `validate_answer`:
        ```python
        threshold = base_threshold - (0.15 * query_length_factor) # Loosen context threshold more
        return answer_context_sim > threshold and answer_query_sim > 0.4 # Loosen both thresholds
        ```
        If loosening the thresholds resolves the issue, it suggests that the validation was too strict for your specific data or model. In a production setting, you might need to fine-tune these thresholds or improve the quality of context and answers. **Remember to revert these changes after debugging.**

**3. Embedding Issues:**

* **Problem:** If there are issues with embedding generation (either for the chunks, query, or answer), the similarity calculations in `validate_answer` and `hybrid_search` might be incorrect, leading to poor retrieval and validation failures.
* **How to Check:**
    * **Verify embedding model loading:** Ensure the SentenceTransformer model is loaded correctly without errors during `load_resources`. The output log seems to indicate successful resource loading, but double-check for any warnings during startup.
    * **Test embedding generation separately:** You can test the embedding model independently to see if it's generating reasonable embeddings for sample text.  You can add a small test snippet after `embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(...)` in `load_resources`:
        ```python
        if embedding_model:
            sample_text = "This is a test sentence."
            sample_embedding = embedding_model.encode([sample_text])
            print("Sample embedding shape:", sample_embedding.shape)
            print("Sample embedding values (first 10):", sample_embedding[0][:10])
        ```
        This will print the shape and the first few values of an embedding for a simple sentence, helping you confirm that the model is working.

**4. Elasticsearch Indexing and Search Issues:**

* **Problem:** Although you see "Elasticsearch indexing complete" and "Successfully connected to Elasticsearch", there might still be issues with how the data is indexed or searched in Elasticsearch.
* **How to Check:**
    * **Verify Elasticsearch index content:** Use a tool like `curl` or a dedicated Elasticsearch client (like Kibana Dev Tools if you have access) to query your Elasticsearch index directly. Check if your documents are actually indexed in the `chunks` index and if the `chunk` field contains the expected text content.
        ```bash
        curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/chunks/_search?pretty" -u elastic:your_elasticsearch_password
        ```
        Replace `your_elasticsearch_password` with your actual password. Examine the `hits.hits` section of the output to see indexed documents.
    * **Test Elasticsearch search independently:** Test a simple Elasticsearch query using `curl` or Kibana to see if you can retrieve documents based on keywords from your query. This isolates Elasticsearch search functionality from the rest of the RAG pipeline.
        ```bash
        curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/chunks/_search?pretty" -u elastic:your_elasticsearch_password -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
        {
          "query": {
            "match": {
              "chunk": "your keyword from query"
            }
          }
        }
        '
        ```
        Replace `"your keyword from query"` with a relevant keyword from your test query.

**5. Environment Variable and Configuration Issues:**

* **Problem:** While the log shows Elasticsearch connection is successful, double-check if all other necessary environment variables (`MODEL_NAME`, `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY`, `SAMBANOVA_API_BASE_URL`) are correctly set. A missing or incorrect API key could lead to LLM response generation failures, although this is less likely to directly cause the "apology" message but worth verifying.
* **How to Check:**
    * **Print environment variables in the code:**  Temporarily add print statements at the beginning of `load_resources` to print the environment variables being used:
        ```python
        def load_resources():
            print("MODEL_NAME:", MODEL_NAME)
            print("SAMBANOVA_API_BASE_URL:", SAMBANOVA_API_BASE_URL)
            # ... rest of load_resources
        ```
        Verify that these printed values are indeed correct.

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Implement the print statements** in `query_rag_system` and `validate_answer` as suggested in points 1 and 2 above.
2. **Run your query again** and carefully examine the output in your console.
3. **Analyze the output:**
    * **Number of relevant chunks:** Is it zero? If yes, investigate `hybrid_search` and Elasticsearch/FAISS indexing.
    * **Similarity scores in `validate_answer`:** Are they low? If yes, it could be an answer relevance issue, context relevance issue, or embedding issue.
    * **Validation Result:** Is it consistently `False`? This confirms the validation is failing.
4. **If relevant chunks are zero:**
    * Test Elasticsearch and FAISS indexing and search independently (point 4).
    * Verify your data is in the `data` directory and PDFs are valid.
    * Re-run indexing to ensure indices are built correctly.
5. **If similarity scores are low, but relevant chunks are retrieved:**
    * Test embedding generation independently (point 3).
    * Examine the generated `context` string in `query_rag_system` – is it actually relevant to your query? Print the `context` before passing it to the LLM.
    * Consider loosening validation thresholds temporarily (point 2) to see if validation is too strict.

By systematically going through these checks and analyzing the added print outputs, you should be able to pinpoint the reason for the "I apologize..." message and take corrective action. Let me know the output of these checks, and we can further refine the debugging process.
