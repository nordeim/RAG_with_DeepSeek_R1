#### General's Departure

If you're a great general of God and you're about to depart this world; Not only countless entourage of Angels but also some men of God might come also to welcome you. And when you’ll take off in that heavenly private jet, you’ll begin to hear that sweet melody. 

When you get There, the door will open on its own by your works. And you’ll hear the voice of your Father thundering, 

> “This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Well done thou good and faithful servant, when I am hungry you gave me food to eat...”

Immediately He speaks, before you even know it, you'll be given that crown and that royal robe dipped in blood. You’ll be fully decorated and angels will be assigned to you immediately. 

And He also will begin to appear to His people. This is why some people will say 

> "We see him with angels."
