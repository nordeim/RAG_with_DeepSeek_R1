You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Your task: carefully review the attached python code, web_RAG-v1.py, for any coding or logic error, then think deeply and thoroughly to understand the code logic and flow and possible improvements. also fix the following error:

*Your task:* carefully review the design document for a python based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, rag_app-v2.py, below for any coding or logic errors. Use the recommendations in the design document below as your starting point to think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options to enhance the app to be more robust, more capable, with a query output display box that support copying and saving the content.

```
can you carefully review your latest generated code against the original code to ensure that your improved code aligns with the design document and retains all original functionalities? your generated is only half the size of the original code and missing some of the original functionalities. after careful comparison, generate again a complete revised, fully tested code with corrections.

*Your task:* carefully review the attached python code, rag_app-v6.py, for any coding or logic error, then think deeply and thoroughly to evaluate various implementation options to merge the following suggested improvements to the code, then update the code after choosing the most optimal implementation option for merging the changes while taking great care not to affect other parts of the code. remember to validate your intended changes before implementing them.
```

```
carefully review your updated code versus the original code, rag_app-v8.py, to double-check and validate that the updated code is complete and fully tested working and that the suggested fix has been merged without affecting other parts of the code. use line by line comparison of the two codes for your verification and validation/confirmation.
