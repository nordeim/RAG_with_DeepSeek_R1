First I will carefully review the python code from the given URL to understand its functionalities and identify potential issues that could lead to the reported error. After code review, I will focus on the error "openai.NotFoundError: 404 page not found" and think step by step to find out the root cause and fix it. Finally, I will suggest possible improvements for the code.

**Code Review:**
The python script `web_RAG-v4.py` is a Gradio application designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using OpenAI models. It allows users to upload documents (text, PDF, DOCX), ask questions, and receive answers generated by an LLM based on the document content.

**Functionality Breakdown:**

1.  **Document Loading and Chunking**:
    *   `load_document(file)`: Handles loading different document types (txt, pdf, docx) using libraries like `docx2txt`, `PyPDFLoader`, and simple text file reading.
    *   `chunk_text(text, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)`: Splits the loaded text into smaller chunks to manage context size for embedding and LLM processing.

2.  **Embedding Creation**:
    *   `create_embeddings(chunk_texts, embedding_model_name)`: This function is crucial and where the error occurs. It uses the OpenAI API (`openai.OpenAI().embeddings.create`) to generate embeddings for the text chunks. It initializes an OpenAI client and sends a request to the embeddings API endpoint.

3.  **Vector Database Management (FAISS)**:
    *   `create_vector_database(embeddings, chunk_metadatas)`: Creates a FAISS index to store the generated embeddings for efficient similarity search.
    *   `load_vector_database(embeddings_path)`: Loads a pre-existing FAISS index from a specified path.
    *   `save_vector_database(vector_database, embeddings_path)`: Saves the FAISS index to a file for later use.
    *   `search_vector_database(vector_database, query_embedding, top_k)`: Searches the FAISS index to find the most relevant text chunks based on the query embedding.

4.  **Language Model Interaction (OpenAI)**:
    *   `generate_answer(query, context, model_name)`: Uses the OpenAI API (`openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create`) to generate answers based on the user's query and the retrieved relevant document chunks (context).

5.  **Gradio User Interface**:
    *   The script sets up a Gradio interface with:
        *   Input components: Document upload (`gr.File()`), question text (`gr.Textbox()`), embedding model selection (`gr.Dropdown()`), LLM model selection (`gr.Dropdown()`), chunk size and overlap sliders (`gr.Slider()`).
        *   Output component: Answer display (`gr.Textbox()`).
    *   The UI is structured to allow users to upload a document, adjust parameters, ask questions, and receive answers.

**Error Analysis: 404 Page Not Found**

The error message "openai.NotFoundError: 404 page not found" specifically points to an issue when calling the OpenAI Embeddings API in the `create_embeddings` function. A 404 error typically means that the requested resource (in this case, the API endpoint for embeddings) could not be found at the specified URL.

**Possible Root Causes:**

1.  **Incorrect API Endpoint or Base URL**: While less likely with the official OpenAI library, there might be a misconfiguration in the OpenAI client setup or the library might be trying to access an outdated or incorrect endpoint. However, the code uses `openai.OpenAI()`, which should use the standard OpenAI base URL.

2.  **Incorrect Model Name**: The `embedding_model_name` variable might be set to a model that either does not exist or is not accessible via the embeddings API endpoint.  It's crucial to verify that the model name `text-embedding-ada-002` (default in the script) is still valid and available in the OpenAI API.  An incorrect or outdated model name in the API request could result in a 404 error if the API endpoint is model-specific and the model is not found.

3.  **Authentication Issues (API Key Problems)**: Although a 404 error is typically for 'not found', authentication issues can sometimes manifest in unexpected ways. It's important to ensure that the OpenAI API key is correctly configured and has the necessary permissions to access the embeddings API. If the API key is invalid or missing, the request might be rejected before even reaching the specific resource, potentially resulting in a 404 if the routing is not properly handling unauthenticated requests.

4.  **Network Issues (Less Likely in this context)**: Transient network problems could theoretically cause API request failures, but a persistent 404 suggests a more fundamental issue with the request itself rather than just a temporary network glitch.

**Debugging and Fix Steps:**

1.  **Verify `embedding_model_name`**:
    *   Check the OpenAI API documentation to confirm that `text-embedding-ada-002` is still the correct and current model name for embeddings. It is indeed a valid and widely used model. However, users might have mistakenly changed this to an invalid name or an older version. **Fix: Make it easily configurable and double-check against OpenAI documentation.**

2.  **Check OpenAI API Key Configuration**:
    *   The code uses `client = OpenAI()`, which relies on the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable being correctly set. **Action: Add explicit instructions in the code comments to guide users on how to set up their OpenAI API key as an environment variable.**  A missing or incorrect API key is a very common issue.

3.  **Test API Key and Model Name Directly with a Minimal Script**:
    *   Create a very simple Python script to directly test the OpenAI embeddings API call using the same model name and API key. This can isolate whether the problem is within the `web_RAG-v4.py` script or a more fundamental setup issue (API key, model name, network, OpenAI service status).

    ```python
    import openai
    import os

    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") # Ensure API key is set in environment

    embedding_model_name = "text-embedding-ada-002" # Use the same model name

    try:
        response = openai.embeddings.create(
            input="This is a test.",
            model=embedding_model_name,
        )
        print("Embeddings API call successful!")
        print(response)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

    ```
    Running this minimal script will help determine if the API key and model name are working correctly in a basic setting. If this script fails with a 404, it strongly suggests an API key or model name issue. If it works, the problem is more likely within the larger `web_RAG-v4.py` script or its environment.

4.  **Error Handling Improvement in `create_embeddings`**:
    *   Enhance the error handling in the `create_embeddings` function to specifically catch `openai.NotFoundError` and provide a more informative error message to the user, guiding them to check their API key and model name.

**Applying Fixes to the Code**

Based on the analysis, the most likely causes are related to incorrect `embedding_model_name` or API key setup. Let's modify the code to address these and improve error reporting.

**Code Modifications:**

1.  **Make `embedding_model_name` and `llm_model_name` variables at the top of the script for easy configuration.** This makes it immediately obvious where to change these settings.
2.  **Add comments at the beginning of the script reminding users to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.** Provide clear instructions.
3.  **Modify `create_embeddings` function to specifically catch `openai.NotFoundError` and print a more user-friendly error message that suggests checking the model name and API key.**

**Improved Error Handling in `create_embeddings` Function**:
```python
def create_embeddings(chunk_texts, embedding_model_name):
    try:
        client = OpenAI()
        response = client.embeddings.create(input=chunk_texts, model=embedding_model_name)
        return response.data
    except openai.NotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error during API call for embeddings: Model '{embedding_model_name}' not found or incorrect. Please check the embedding model name and your OpenAI API key. Error details: {e}")
        return None
    except openai.AuthenticationError as e:
        print(f"Error during API call for embeddings: Authentication failed. Please check your OpenAI API key and ensure it is correctly set. Error details: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"General error during API call for embeddings: {e}") # Catch other potential errors
        return None
```

**Adding Configuration Variables at the Top and API Key Instructions**:
Add the following at the beginning of the script:

```python
# --- Configuration ---
embedding_model_name = "text-embedding-ada-002" # Default embedding model, can be changed
llm_model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo" # Default LLM model, can be changed

# **IMPORTANT**: Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY.
# You can do this by running:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
# in your terminal before running the script, or by setting it in your system's environment variables.

# --- End Configuration ---
```

By implementing these changes, we are addressing the most likely causes of the 404 error and improving the user experience by providing better error messages and configuration options.

After these modifications, I will provide the updated code and instructions to the user.

# You can do this by running:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'

**To fix the error and improve the code, I have made the following changes:**

1.  **Configuration Variables**: Added `embedding_model_name` and `llm_model_name` at the top of the script as configuration variables for easy modification.
2.  **API Key Instructions**: Added a clear instruction comment at the beginning of the script, reminding users to set their OpenAI API key as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3.  **Improved Error Handling in `create_embeddings`**:
    *   Specifically caught `openai.NotFoundError` and `openai.AuthenticationError` in the `create_embeddings` function.
    *   Provided more informative error messages for these specific errors, guiding users to check their model name and API key.
    *   Added a general exception catch for other potential API errors.
4.  **Enhanced User Feedback in RAG Pipeline**: In the `rag_pipeline` function, I've added more specific return messages when embedding creation fails, prompting users to check the console for detailed error messages and to verify their API key and embedding model name.

**To use the corrected code and resolve the 404 error, please follow these steps:**

1.  **Set OpenAI API Key**: Ensure you have set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can do this by running `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'` in your terminal (replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key). Alternatively, set it in your system's environment variables.
2.  **Verify Model Names**: Double-check the `embedding_model_name` and `llm_model_name` variables at the top of the script. The default `embedding_model_name = "text-embedding-ada-002"` is generally correct.
3.  **Run the Script**: Execute the python script `web_RAG-v4.py` using `python3 web_RAG-v4.py`.
4.  **Check Console for Errors**: If you still encounter errors, carefully check the console output for the more detailed error messages provided by the improved error handling, especially within the `create_embeddings` function.

By following these steps and using the corrected code, you should be able to resolve the `404 page not found` error and run the Web RAG application successfully. If you still face issues, please review the console output for specific error details and verify your OpenAI API key and model configurations.
