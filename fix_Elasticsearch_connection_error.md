The error message "I apologize, but I cannot generate a reliable answer based on the provided context." combined with the Elasticsearch connection error gives us clues.

Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening and how to fix it:

**1. Elasticsearch Connection Error:**

*   **Problem:** The "Connection refused" error clearly indicates that your Python application cannot connect to the Elasticsearch server. This is the first issue to address because if Elasticsearch is not working, the hybrid search will be degraded, and potentially cause other issues.

*   **Solution:**
    *   **Verify Elasticsearch is Running:**  Make absolutely sure that Elasticsearch is running on your machine. If you installed it locally, you usually need to start it as a separate service. How you start it depends on your installation method (Docker, package manager, etc.).  Check the Elasticsearch documentation for your installation method.
    *   **Check Elasticsearch Port and Host:**  By default, Elasticsearch runs on `http://localhost:9200`.  Verify that your `ES_HOST` environment variable in your `.env` file (or however you are setting environment variables) is correctly set to `http://localhost:9200` if Elasticsearch is running locally. If Elasticsearch is running on a different host or port, update `ES_HOST` accordingly.
    *   **Test Elasticsearch Connection (Simple Test):** Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:9200` (or your `ES_HOST`). If Elasticsearch is running and accessible, you should see a JSON response with cluster information. If you get "connection refused" in your browser too, then Elasticsearch is definitely not reachable at that address.
    *   **Firewall:**  If Elasticsearch is running on a different machine or in a container, ensure that there's no firewall blocking the connection between your Python application's machine and the Elasticsearch server on port 9200 (or whichever port you are using).

**Once you've confirmed Elasticsearch is running and your Python app can connect to it, proceed to the next step if the "reliable answer" message persists.**

**2. "I apologize, but I cannot generate a reliable answer based on the provided context." Message:**

This message means that the `validate_answer` function is returning `False`.  Let's investigate why.

*   **Possible Reasons:**
    *   **Retrieval Issues:** Even if Elasticsearch connection is fixed, the *retrieved context* might be poor quality or irrelevant after your code updates.  If the context is bad, the LLM might generate an answer that is not semantically similar to the context, causing validation to fail.
    *   **Overly Strict Validation:**  The cosine similarity threshold of `0.85` in `validate_answer` might be too high after your changes.  Small changes in embeddings due to code modifications could lead to slightly lower similarity scores, causing valid answers to be rejected.
    *   **Issue in `validate_answer` function itself:** Double-check the `validate_answer` function for any logical errors you might have introduced during updates.

*   **Debugging Steps for "Reliable Answer" Message:**
    *   **Simplify `validate_answer` Temporarily:**  To check if the validation is the *sole* cause, temporarily modify `validate_answer` to *always return `True`*.

        ```python
        def validate_answer(answer: str, context: str) -> bool:
            return True  # TEMPORARILY DISABLE VALIDATION
        ```

        Run your query again.
        *   **If the query *works* now (you get an answer, even if it's not perfect):**  This confirms that the issue is with the `validate_answer` function or the threshold being too strict in the current setup. Proceed to the next sub-steps to investigate validation further.
        *   **If the query *still fails* with the same "reliable answer" message even with `validate_answer` returning `True`:** This is unexpected. Double-check that you actually modified `validate_answer` correctly and restarted your Gradio app. If it still fails, there might be another issue, possibly in the response generation part itself, although the error message *usually* points to validation.

    *   **If you confirmed validation is the issue (by making it always `True` and it worked), now investigate the similarity score:**
        *   **Print Similarity Score:** In the original `validate_answer` function, *before* the `return similarity > 0.85` line, add a `print(f"Similarity Score: {similarity}")`.  Run a query and look at the printed similarity score in your console.
        *   **Analyze Similarity Score:**  Is the similarity score consistently below 0.85, even for what you would consider a good answer? If so, the threshold might be too high. You could try *lowering* the threshold temporarily (e.g., to 0.7 or 0.6) to see if valid answers are then accepted.  If lowering the threshold helps, then you need to consider if 0.85 is appropriate for your use case, or if you need a more dynamic validation approach as suggested in the research paper.
        *   **Examine `context` and `response`:** Before the `validate_answer` call in `query_rag_system`, print both the `context` and the `response`:

            ```python
            # ... inside query_rag_system, before validate_answer(...)
            print("Context:\n", context)
            print("Response:\n", response)
            is_valid = validate_answer(response, context)
            ```

            Analyze the printed `context` and `response`.
            *   **Is the `context` relevant to your query?** If the retrieval is bad, the context will be irrelevant, leading to a poor response and failed validation.  If the context is bad, then the problem is likely in your retrieval logic (hybrid search, FAISS, BM25, Elasticsearch).
            *   **Does the `response` seem reasonable *given* the `context`?**  If the context is good, but the response is still nonsensical or completely unrelated, there might be an issue with the LLM's response generation, but this is less likely if the code changes were focused on retrieval and indexing.

**Action Plan for You:**

1.  **Fix Elasticsearch Connection First:**
    *   **Verify Elasticsearch is running.**
    *   **Check `ES_HOST` environment variable.**
    *   **Test Elasticsearch connection in browser.**
    *   **If necessary, troubleshoot firewall issues.**

2.  **Debug "Reliable Answer" Message:**
    *   **Temporarily disable `validate_answer` (always return `True`) to see if the query then works.**
    *   **If disabling validation works:**
        *   **Print similarity score in `validate_answer` to see the actual scores.**
        *   **Consider lowering the `validate_answer` threshold temporarily.**
        *   **Examine `context` and `response` printed from `query_rag_system` to understand if retrieval is providing relevant context and if the response is reasonable given the context.**
        *   **If the context is bad, focus on debugging your `hybrid_search`, FAISS, BM25, and Elasticsearch integration.**

3.  **Revert if Necessary:** If you get completely stuck, try reverting to your previous version of `rag_app-v6.py` to confirm that the base code was working. Then re-apply your changes incrementally, testing after each change to pinpoint where the problem was introduced.
